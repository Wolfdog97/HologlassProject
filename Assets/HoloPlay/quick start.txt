HoloPlay SDK Quick Start guide:

- Drag the "HoloPlay Capture" prefab into your scene!
- For interaction, add a "HoloPlay -> Realsense Manager" as well //TODO

The inspector for the HoloPlay Capture is where most of the elements can be customized. 
Play around with settings to achieve desired results.

/////////IF YOU HAVE UPGRATED FROM A VERSION < 1.O AND/OR ARE USING ONE OF THE FIRST HOLOPLAYERS!!!

- rename your calibration folder on the HoloPlayer from  HoloPlaySDK_calibration  to LKG_calibration

Then, inside that folder:

- rename the calibration file HoloPlayConfig.json to visual.json

If you see a file named touch_distortionMap.json, do the following:
- rename touch.json to touch_projectionMap.json
- rename touch_distortionMap.json to touch.json
